# Sorting-Algo-Visualizer-

Visualize how sorting algorithm works!
I did this project after a month of studying web development.
The project was made using HTML,CSS,Boostrap, and JS. 
All the animation codes during the sorting can be found on js folder on their respective algorithm.
Built using setTimeout and setInterval with recursion. Using loops won't show the animation correctly.
I hope this can be useful
